/* This file contain all the fix documentation that has been done
   on the compiler since the last release  */

/* ALL THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE MADE BY: TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC.   */


1. Fix the GNU C preprocessor so that it can handle more
   than nine level of nesting.

2. Fix the GNU C Compiler so that it does comparison of double successfully

3. Added #ident directive to the compiler and preprocessor

4. Added traditional style preprocessing of K&R by GNU C Compiler. This
   compiler will still follow the ANSI C rules if -ansi option is
   given and it will not allow traditional style preprocessing on this
   case.

5. Fix the m68k.md file or md file so it generate jbsr instruction
   for 68020 or jsr for 68010 on TI S1500. This eliminate the need
   of modifying the insn-output.c file every time the compiler is
   built.

6. Added a option -NOIDENT to the Compiler so that the compiler
   will throw out the #ident directive. The GNU C Compiler does not
   throw out #ident by default.

7. Added a option call -SLINK to suppress the link warning message
   only. It will not suppress linking. Only thing it suppresses is
   the warning message :
    warning:linker input file unused since linking not done

8. Fixed the problem of ignored volatile. If a variable declared
   volatile it is treated as volatile.
      module: c-decl.c , c-expr.c

9. If a function return type declared volatile it used to
   generate bad code. The function of volatile would
   never return. The problem is fixed. 
     module: c-decl.c

10. A function pointer declared volatile used to generate
    bad code. The problem is fixed.
     module: c-decl.c

11. The storage allocation for 68010 has been changed to put
    character strings on even boundary. The 68020 code generation
    remain unchanged.
     module: varasm.c

12. Fix the GNU C compiler to handle the smallest 2's complement number 
    -2147483648 on S1500.
      c-pares.y (yylex) and tree.c

13.  Make the compiler generate a nop instruction before the following
   floating point instructions: 

   fseq      fsne   fsgt    fslt  fsge   fsle
 

   config/m68k.md


14. Added the following linker options to the compiler:

  -a -f -m -VS -V -Z

   Note all these options should be used as directed by the System V
   linker manual.

    gcc.c


15. Added #pragma EXTENSIONS directive to the compiler for eliminating the
    warning messages given by the compiler when using GNU C extensions.
    (Requested by Software QIT)

   NOTE: IF YOU ARE USING ANY GNU C EXTENSIONS AS DESCRIBED IN GNU C
         USER MANUAL CHAPTER 6, YOU WILL GET A WARNING MESSAGE. TO ELIMINATE
         THE WARNING MESSAGE ADD THE FOLLOWING AT THE TOP OF YOUR FILE:

         #pragma EXTENSIONS

   THIS IS JUST A WAY TO DOCUMENT THAT YOU ARE USING GNU C EXTENSION.
